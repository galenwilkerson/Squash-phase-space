# Squash-phase-space
Initial explorations into the phase space of the racquet sport of squash.

An experienced squash player will realize that this is a game where you try to exploit corners of the phase space of the game.

That is, an opponent might for example be in the right position, but have the wrong velocity.

Or they might have the right velocity, but be too far away.

A point can be score by hitting a long slow lob to the back of the court, or by a fast low shot along the wall.

In this notebook we begin setting up a framework to do that.  

More work is needed!
